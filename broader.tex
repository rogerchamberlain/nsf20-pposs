\section{Broader Impacts}
\label{sec:broader}

\FIXME{RC: say something about how what we are doing is important in
areas beyond our particular driver applications.}

We are committed to promoting diversity and will seek opportunities to
involve students from underrepresented groups in this project.
We will leverage a pair of existing university programs to help us
attract students from traditionally underrepresented groups.  The Olin
Fellowship Program (for women) and the Chancellor's Fellowship Program
(aimed at African-American students) have had a successful track
record of enabling individuals to pursue graduate study.  In our
experience, the most effective method for attracting students from
underrepresented groups is by personal contact with a suitable role
model.  To facilitate this, we regularly ask the appropriately
qualified individuals in our group to be actively involved in the
recruiting process.  This cohort currently includes two female
faculty and one minority (African-American)
graduate student.

\FIXME{RC: I'm always open to new ideas of things we could do in
this area.  Given that this is a planning grant, we'd of course really be
talking about the eventually funded research grant.}
